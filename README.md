# Transfer Entropy Analysis

Implementation of Transfer Entropy (TE) for analyzing directional information flow between variables.

## Overview
This code demonstrates the calculation of transfer entropy and related information theory measures to analyze directional relationships between time series variables.

## Key Concepts
- **Entropy**: Average uncertainty of a random variable
- **Mutual Information**: Shared information between two variables
- **Transfer Entropy**: Conditional mutual information with time delay

## Mathematical Framework
Core equations implemented:
- Shannon Entropy: H(X) = -âˆ‘p(x)log p(x)
- Transfer Entropy: TE = H(Xfuture|Xpast) - H(Xfuture|Xpast,Ypast)

## Example Implementation
Includes:
1. Setup of required Python packages
2. Implementation of TE calculation functions using dit package
3. Simulation examples demonstrating time-delayed mutual information and transfer entropy
